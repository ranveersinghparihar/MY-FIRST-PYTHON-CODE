#question 1- make three types of data (string,float,integer) and then the random integer made needs to be converted into string and float?

#answer--
a = 10

c = 10.0
a =(str(a))     #from line 24 to 
print(type(a))
print(a)
a =(float(a))

print(type(b))
print(b)
b =(float(b))
print(type(b))
print(b)       #line 36 is for converting 'b'
